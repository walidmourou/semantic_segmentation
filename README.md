# Semantic Segmentation using Deep learning
Nowadays, semantic segmentation is one of the key problems in the field of computer vision. Looking at the big picture, semantic segmentation is one of the high-level task that paves the way towards complete scene understanding. The importance of scene understanding as a core computer vision problem is highlighted by the fact that an increasing number of applications nourish from inferring knowledge from imagery. Some of those applications include self-driving vehicles, human-computer interaction, virtual reality etc. With the popularity of deep learning in recent years, many semantic segmentation problems are being tackled using deep architectures, most often Convolutional Neural Nets, which surpass other approaches by a large margin in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

## What is Semantic Segmentation?
Semantic segmentation is a natural step in the progression from coarse to fine inference:

* The origin could be located at classification, which consists of making a prediction for a whole input.
* The next step is localization / detection, which provide not only the classes but also additional information regarding the spatial location of those classes.
* Finally, semantic segmentation achieves fine-grained inference by making dense predictions inferring labels for every pixel, so that each pixel is labeled with the class of its enclosing object ore region.
